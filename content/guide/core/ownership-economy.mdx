title: Ownership Economy
description: Empower individuals with greater control over their assets and data.

The proclaimed right to free speech is protected by many laws, but the economic benefits derived from the underlying assets and data are often overlooked.

High-quality information is what enables generational knowledge to be passed on, and ensures the human race prosper for millenniums to come (hopefully). An fair and transparent Ownership Economy is often regarded as one of the economic models to promote creation of high-quality information.

Fostering a sustainable Ownership Economy has never been easy, despite attempts by visionaries like Aaron Swartz and Tim Berners-Lee. While seemingly impossible, we should never give up and allow our valuable digital commodity, community, and their underlying rights to be eroded.

> A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. â€” Lao Tzu

Open has taken a small step forward by promoting a fair and transparent Ownership Economy via multiple fronts, including the Open Chain (and OVM), Open Node, and Open Stack.
Open is committed to empowering individuals with greater control over their assets and data, and ensuring that the economic benefits derived from them are shared fairly and transparently.

Not only that, Open is also the umbrella organization for [RSS3](https://rss3.io) and [RSSHub](https://rsshub.io), evangelizing the Ownership Economy by promoting the creation and distribution of high-quality open information and economic benefits.

**In an Ownership Economy, it does not have to be a zero-sum game, and no one has to lose out.**
