## Introduction

Open Virtual Machine, or OVM, is a high-performance, scalable, and secure virtual machine that is designed to run together with the Open Chain.

## Features

### High Performance Compute (HPC)

OVM sources compute from decentralized and verifiable sources, such as Open Nodes, 

### Interoperability

OVM is EVM-compatible, which means that it supports native execution of Solidity smart contracts.

In fact, it interoperates with any blockchains, EVM or not.

### Language-agnostism

OVM employs state-of-the-art virtualization technology, meaning that it can execute any program written in any language.

### Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)

OVM is equipped with a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), which ensures that the execution environment is secure and tamper-proof.

Sensitive data and operations are executed within the TEE, ensuring that secrets are never exposed to the external risks.
