Open Virtual Machine (OVM) is a high-performance, scalable, and secure virtual machine that is designed to run together with the Open Chain blockchain.
OVM is EVM-compatible, which means that it can run Solidity smart contracts and interact with other EVM-compatible blockchains.
Not only that, OVM is language-agnostic, meaning that it can run execute any program in the world.
