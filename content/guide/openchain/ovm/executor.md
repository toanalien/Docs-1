## Introduction

An OVM task is executed by an OVM executor, which is a high-performance, scalable, and secure virtual machine.

Executors announce their availability to the network and are selected by the OVM gateway to execute tasks based on the requirements specified in the task contract.

Executors are rewarded for their services, and the results of the task execution are recorded on-chain to offer verifiability and transparency.
